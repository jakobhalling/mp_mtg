# Web Framework Selection for MTG Multiplayer Online Game

After researching various web frameworks and libraries suitable for our MTG multiplayer online game with WebRTC peer-to-peer functionality, I've analyzed the options and made recommendations below.

## Framework Comparison

### React
**Pros:**
- Large ecosystem with many libraries and components
- Virtual DOM for efficient rendering (important for card game UI updates)
- Flexible component-based architecture
- Strong community support and extensive documentation
- Many existing card game implementations using React
- Works well with WebRTC libraries like simple-peer

**Cons:**
- Only handles the view layer, requires additional libraries for routing, state management, etc.
- Steeper learning curve compared to Vue

### Vue
**Pros:**
- Progressive framework that's easy to learn and integrate
- Virtual DOM similar to React
- Clear separation of concerns (template, script, style)
- Good performance for reactive updates

**Cons:**
- Smaller ecosystem compared to React
- Fewer examples of WebRTC and card game implementations
- Less mature TypeScript support

### Angular
**Pros:**
- Full-featured framework with built-in solutions for routing, forms, HTTP, etc.
- Strong typing with TypeScript
- Comprehensive documentation

**Cons:**
- Heavier and more opinionated than React or Vue
- Uses real DOM instead of virtual DOM (potentially slower for our use case)
- Steeper learning curve
- Less flexible for our specific card game requirements

## WebRTC Libraries

### simple-peer
- Concise, Node.js style API for WebRTC
- Works in both browser and Node.js environments
- Supports video/voice streams and data channels
- Handles text and binary data
- Provides a duplex stream interface
- Supports advanced options like trickle ICE candidates
- Well-maintained with 7.6k+ stars on GitHub

### PeerJS
- Abstracts WebRTC implementation details
- Simplifies peer connection establishment
- Good for video chat applications and multiplayer games
- Provides a simple API

## Recommended Stack

Based on the research, I recommend the following technology stack for our MTG multiplayer online game:

1. **Primary Framework: React**
   - Best balance of flexibility, performance, and ecosystem support
   - Strong community with many examples and resources
   - Efficient rendering with virtual DOM (important for card game UI)
   - Component-based architecture fits well with card game elements

2. **WebRTC Library: simple-peer**
   - Concise API that works well with React
   - Supports all our P2P data channel requirements
   - Well-maintained and widely used
   - Works in both browser and Node.js environments

3. **Additional Libraries:**
   - Redux or Context API for state management
   - React DnD (Drag and Drop) for card manipulation
   - Socket.io for signaling server
   - Tailwind CSS for responsive UI

## Implementation Approach

1. Use Create React App to bootstrap the project
2. Integrate simple-peer for WebRTC data channels
3. Implement a lightweight signaling server with Node.js and Socket.io
4. Use React's component system to create reusable card and game board elements
5. Implement the P2P consensus mechanism using simple-peer's data channels
6. Use Scryfall API for card data and images

This stack provides the best balance of performance, flexibility, and developer experience for our MTG multiplayer online game requirements.

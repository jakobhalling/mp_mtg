# MTG Multiplayer Online Platform Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing approach for the MTG multiplayer online platform to ensure all components work correctly together before deployment.

## Test Environment Setup
1. Start the server
2. Start the client application
3. Open multiple browser instances to simulate different players

## Test Cases

### 1. Authentication Tests
- [ ] User registration with valid credentials
- [ ] User registration with invalid credentials (error handling)
- [ ] User login with valid credentials
- [ ] User login with invalid credentials (error handling)
- [ ] Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to login
- [ ] Logout functionality

### 2. Game Lobby Tests
- [ ] Create a new game with valid parameters
- [ ] List available games on the home page
- [ ] Join an existing game
- [ ] Generate and copy invite link
- [ ] Join game via invite link
- [ ] Import deck with valid format
- [ ] Import deck with invalid format (error handling)
- [ ] Start game as host
- [ ] Game lobby displays correct player count and status

### 3. P2P Connection Tests
- [ ] Establish WebRTC connection between two players
- [ ] Establish WebRTC connections in a 3-4 player game
- [ ] Handle player disconnection and reconnection
- [ ] Signaling server correctly facilitates initial connections

### 4. Game State Management Tests
- [ ] Initialize game state with player decks
- [ ] Draw cards from library to hand
- [ ] Play cards from hand to battlefield
- [ ] Move cards between zones (hand, battlefield, graveyard, exile)
- [ ] Update life totals
- [ ] Change game phases
- [ ] Pass turn between players
- [ ] Add/remove counters to cards
- [ ] Create tokens
- [ ] State synchronization between players
- [ ] Majority-decides consensus mechanism for conflict resolution

### 5. UI Interaction Tests

- [ ] Game controls (draw, phase change, etc.) function correctly

### 6. Performance Tests
- [ ] Load testing with maximum player count (4 players)
- [ ] Network latency simulation
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring during extended gameplay

## Test Execution Plan
1. Execute unit tests for individual components
2. Perform integration tests for connected components
3. Conduct end-to-end testing of complete game flow
4. Test with multiple simultaneous users
5. Document and fix any issues found

## Bug Tracking
All issues found during testing will be documented with:
- Issue description
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Screenshots/recordings when applicable
- Priority level
